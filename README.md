Responsive project I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I predominantly utilized CSS features, and I particularly enjoy the transition effects in the navbar and trend cards. It was a project where I learned about the concept of local storage, and when I look back, I can see how far I've come. I'm considering adding dark theme in near future.
